# Mathematical Foundations & Rating Formulations

This document provides the formal mathematical derivations for the three rating models implemented in **Through the Ages (TTA) Rating Engine**:
1. **Glicko-2 Standard** (Naive Pairwise 1v1)
2. **Glicko-2 MP-Weighted** (Coulom-Weighted Fractional Pairwise)
3. **Whole-History Rating (WHR)** (Continuous Brownian Motion MAP)

---

## 1. Glicko-2 Standard Formulation

The standard Glicko-2 system (Glickman, 2012) models each player by three parameters:
- Rating $\mu$ (scaled such that $\mu = (r - 1500) / 173.7178$)
- Rating Deviation $\phi$ (scaled such that $\phi = RD / 173.7178$)
- Rating Volatility $\sigma$ (degree of expected rating fluctuations)

### 1.1 Match Likelihood & Expected Outcome
Against an opponent with rating $\mu_j$ and rating deviation $\phi_j$, the expected outcome $E$ is given by:

$$
g(\phi_j) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + 3\phi_j^2 / \pi^2}}
$$

$$
E(\mu, \mu_j, \phi_j) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-g(\phi_j)(\mu - \mu_j))}
$$

### 1.2 Step Equations (Sequential Update)
For $m$ match encounters in a rating period with observed scores $s_j \in \{1.0, 0.5, 0.0\}$:

1. **Estimated Variance ($v$)**:

   $$
   v = \left[ \sum_{j=1}^{m} g(\phi_j)^2 E_j (1 - E_j) \right]^{-1}
   $$

2. **Estimated Improvement ($\Delta$)**:

   $$
   \Delta = v \sum_{j=1}^{m} g(\phi_j) (s_j - E_j)
   $$

3. **Volatility Update ($\sigma'$)**:
   Using the Illinois bracket root-finding algorithm, find $x = \ln(\sigma'^2)$ such that $f(x) = 0$, where $a = \ln(\sigma^2)$:

   $$
   f(x) = \frac{e^x (\Delta^2 - \phi^2 - v - e^x)}{2 (\phi^2 + v + e^x)^2} - \frac{x - a}{\tau^2}
   $$

4. **New Rating Deviation ($\phi'$) and Mean ($\mu'$)**:

   $$
   \phi^* = \sqrt{\phi^2 + \sigma'^2}
   $$

   $$
   \phi' = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{(\phi^*)^2} + \frac{1}{v}}}
   $$

   $$
   \mu' = \mu + (\phi')^2 \sum_{j=1}^{m} g(\phi_j)(s_j - E_j)
   $$

5. **Conservative Rating**:

   $$
   C = r - 3 \times RD
   $$

   This represents the lower 99.7% confidence bound of a player's true skill.

## 2. The Multiplayer Flaw & Glicko-2 MP-Weighted Formulation

### 2.1 The Problem with Naive Pairwise Decomposition
In an $N$-player game (e.g. 4-player TTA), a player simultaneously plays against 3 opponents. Naive decomposition treats this single match as $(N - 1) = 3$ independent 1v1 duels.

Because Fisher information $v^{-1} = \sum g^2 E(1-E)$ sums over all opponents, a 4-player match yields **$3\times$ the information of a 2-player match**. 

In the variance equation:

$$
\frac{1}{(\phi')^2} = \frac{1}{(\phi^*)^2} + \frac{1}{v}
$$

$\frac{1}{v}$ is 3 times larger, meaning the rating deviation $\phi$ shrinks up to $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.73$ times faster than warranted by real game entropy. This causes premature confidence, rating crystallization, and ranking instability when players participate predominantly in 4-player lobbies.

### 2.2 The Coulom Fractional Match Weight Solution
To preserve correct evidence accumulation, each pairwise encounter derived from an $N$-player match is assigned a fractional weight:

$$
w_j = \frac{1}{N - 1}
$$

- 2-player duel: $N=2 \implies w_j = 1.0$ (Standard Glicko-2)
- 3-player match: $N=3 \implies w_j = 0.5$ (2 opponents $\times 0.5 = 1.0$ effective match)
- 4-player match: $N=4 \implies w_j = \frac{1}{3}$ (3 opponents $\times \frac{1}{3} = 1.0$ effective match)

### 2.3 Mathematical Integration
1. **Weighted Inverted Variance ($v_w^{-1}$)**:

   $$
   v_w = \left[ \sum_{j=1}^{m} w_j \cdot g(\phi_j)^2 E_j (1 - E_j) \right]^{-1}
   $$

2. **Weighted Improvement ($\Delta_w$)**:

   $$
   \Delta_w = v_w \sum_{j=1}^{m} w_j \cdot g(\phi_j) (s_j - E_j)
   $$

3. **Invariance of Volatility Search**:
   Because $v_w$ scales by $(N - 1)$ and $\sum w_j \dots$ scales by $\frac{1}{N - 1}$, $\Delta_w$ maintains the exact physical magnitude of a standard 2-player duel. Thus, $f(x)$ remains strictly bounded, and Illinois root-finding converges with standard tolerances.

4. **Updated Parameters**:

   $$
   \frac{1}{(\phi')^2} = \frac{1}{(\phi^*)^2} + \frac{1}{v_w}
   $$

   $$
   \mu' = \mu + (\phi')^2 \sum_{j=1}^{m} w_j \cdot g(\phi_j)(s_j - E_j)
   $$


**Conclusion**: The effective sample size per match event is strictly 1.0. Ratings remain on the standard 1500 scale while rating deviation ($RD$) reliably reflects true information entropy.

## 3. Whole-History Rating (WHR)

Whole-History Rating (Coulom, 2008) is a global Bayesian model that simultaneously fits a player's entire career trajectory across time.

### 3.1 Prior: Wiener Process (Brownian Motion)
A player's skill $r(t)$ on day $t$ evolves as a continuous random walk:

$$
r(t_2) \sim \mathcal{N}(r(t_1), \; w^2 |t_2 - t_1|)
$$

where $w^2$ is the skill variance drift rate per day ($w^2 = 0.002$ in our calibrated implementation).

### 3.2 Likelihood & Objective Function
Under the Bradley-Terry model, the probability of player $i$ beating opponent $j$ on day $t$ is:

$$
P(i > j) = \frac{\exp(r_i(t))}{1 + \exp(r_i(t) - r_j(t))}
$$

The joint posterior log-density is the sum of game log-likelihoods and Brownian prior transition log-densities:

$$
\ln P(R \mid \text{Games}) = \sum_{\text{games}} \ln P(\text{outcome}) - \sum_{\text{players}} \sum_{k} \frac{(r(t_{k+1}) - r(t_k))^2}{2 w^2 (t_{k+1} - t_k)} + \text{const}
$$

### 3.3 Optimization via Thomas Algorithm
Maximization with respect to $r_i = [r_i(t_1), \dots, r_i(t_K)]^T$ yields a symmetric positive-definite **tridiagonal system**:

$$
A_i \Delta r_i = \mathrm{rhs}_i
$$

where:
- $A_i = H_{\text{lik}} + \Sigma_{\text{prior}}^{-1}$
- $\mathrm{rhs}_i = g_{\text{lik}} - \Sigma_{\text{prior}}^{-1} r_i$

This system is solved in linear time $\mathcal{O}(K)$ per player using the **Thomas algorithm** (forward elimination and back substitution). By cycling through all players iteratively, the system converges in 5--7 Newton-Raphson iterations across all 9 years of history.

## 4. Seasonal Reset Mechanisms & Empirical Parameter Formulations

To address **career legacy inertia**—where veterans with hundreds of matches accumulate narrow rating deviation ($\mathrm{RD} \approx 30-50$) that resists seasonal performance—the rating engine provides seasonal reset transformations applied across calendar year boundaries.

### 4.1 Mathematical Transformation
Each annual reset operates on a 2D parameter vector $(\alpha, \lambda) \in [1.0, 3.0] \times [0.0, 1.0]$:

1. **Uncertainty / RD Expansion ($\alpha$)**:
   Increases rating deviation to account for off-season rust, balance shifts, and meta turnover:

   $$
   \mathrm{RD}_{\mathrm{new}} = \min(350.0, \; \mathrm{RD} \cdot \alpha)
   $$

2. **Mean Reversion / Tier Compression ($\lambda$)**:
   Gently pulls ratings toward the anchor of their 16-tier division bracket ($\mu_{\mathrm{target}}$):

   $$
   \mu_{\mathrm{new}} = (1 - \lambda)\,\mu + \lambda\,\mu_{\mathrm{target}}
   $$

### 4.2 Derivation of Reset Tiers

The rating engine supports four distinct reset configurations:

1. **Continuous (Standard Lifetime Baseline)**:
   - $(\alpha = 1.000, \; \lambda = 0.000)$
   - Retains unbroken lifetime Bayesian trajectory across all tournament matches.

2. **Softer Season Reset (Geometric / Arithmetic Midpoint)**:
   - Derived as a gentler intermediate tier:
     
     $$
     \alpha_{\mathrm{softer}} = \frac{\phi + \sqrt{\phi}}{2} \approx 1.445027
     $$
     
     $$
     \lambda_{\mathrm{softer}} = \frac{\phi^{-3}}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \frac{1}{\phi}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\phi}\right) \approx 0.118034
     $$

   - Halves the tier pull ($\lambda \approx 11.8\%$) while taking the arithmetic mean of $\phi$ and $\sqrt{\phi}$ for uncertainty inflation ($\alpha \approx 1.445$). This preserves earned skill differentials between top competitors while expanding uncertainty to stimulate seasonal activity.

3. **Soft Season Reset (Canonical Golden Ratio Powers)**:
   - Formulated using integer powers of the Golden Ratio ($\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618034$):
     
     $$
     \alpha_{\mathrm{soft}} = \phi \approx 1.618034, \quad \lambda_{\mathrm{soft}} = \phi^{-3} \approx 0.236068
     $$

   - Provides harmonic seasonal decay: $\mathrm{RD}$ expands by $+61.8\%$ and ratings regress $23.6\%$ toward the 16-tier anchor.

4. **Hard Season Reset (&ldquo;Amplified&rdquo; &mdash; Illustrative Comparison)**:
   - Formulated with higher powers of $\phi$:
     
     $$
     \alpha_{\mathrm{hard}} = \phi^2 \approx 2.618034, \quad \lambda_{\mathrm{hard}} = \phi^{-1} \approx 0.618034
     $$

   - *Kept strictly for illustrative and diagnostic purposes* to demonstrate the hazards of excessive seasonal compression.

### 4.3 Empirical Walk-Forward Out-of-Sample Benchmark (308,000+ Matches)

```

### 4.4 Key Insights
1. **The Softer Reset delivers optimal predictive balance**:
   Softer Reset achieves the lowest overall calibration error ($0.34\%$), beating Continuous while prioritizing recent form alongside career skill.
2. **Excessive Tier Compression degrades skill separation**:
   Aggressive tier pull ($\lambda = 0.618$) forces top competitors artificially closer to tier boundaries, causing Brier error to surge.
3. **Status of the Hard Reset Mode**:
   The **Hard Season Reset** is retained in the engine and web portal **strictly for illustrative and diagnostic purposes** to give researchers and players a clear visual contrast against calibrated seasonal models.

## 5. Gold Standard Glicko-2 by DANeo (GlickoD*) & Dual-Criterion Recalibration

### 5.1 Architecture of GlickoD*
**GlickoD*** represents the premier predictive flagship model for *Through the Ages*, uniting three mathematically grounded principles:
1. **Golden Ratio ($\phi$) Multiplayer Information Decomposition**: Replaces naive duplication and uniform penalization with self-similar information scaling.
2. **Dual-Criterion Emergent Prior Recalibration**: Eliminates newcomer demographic bleed at the root by discovering true latent skill across active and inactive accounts.
3. **Decoupled Season Reset Dynamics**: Balances career achievement with seasonal form via decoupled variance expansion and dynamic $\phi$-tier regression.

---

### 5.2 Golden Ratio ($\phi$) Information Decomposition

In multiplayer board games ($N \in \{2, 3, 4\}$), pairwise decomposition yields $\binom{N}{2}$ match comparisons. Naive decomposition treats each comparison as a full-evidence duel, tripling evidence in 4-player games ($N-1 = 3$). Conversely, Coulom uniform weighting ($w = 1/(N-1)$) overly dilutes multiplayer information.

DANeo establishes that information decomposition across competing entities naturally follows the Golden Ratio ($\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618034$):

$$
W(N) = \phi^{N-2} \quad \text{(Effective 1v1 Match Equivalents)}
$$

Distributing total information $W(N)$ equally across the $N - 1$ opponents faced by each player produces the exact pairwise weighting factor $w_N$:

$$
w_N = \frac{\phi^{N-2}}{N - 1} \implies
\begin{cases}
w_2 = \frac{\phi^0}{1} = 1.0000 & \text{(2-Player: Pure Glicko-2)} \\[6pt]
w_3 = \frac{\phi^1}{2} = \frac{\phi}{2} \approx 0.8090 & \text{(3-Player)} \\[6pt]
w_4 = \frac{\phi^2}{3} = \frac{\phi + 1}{3} \approx 0.8727 & \text{(4-Player)}
\end{cases}
$$

This guarantees that transitive redundancies $\Delta(3) = \Delta(4) = \phi^{-2} \approx 0.381966$ remain invariant across table sizes.

---

### 5.3 Dual-Criterion Prior Recalibration

#### The Problem: Demographic Asymmetry (1471 vs. 1521)
The nominal mean of the overall player pool is $\mu_{\mathrm{pool}} \approx 1471$, whereas the mean of established tournament veterans is $\mu_{\mathrm{veteran}} \approx 1521$. Newcomers entering with generic $1500$ priors and maximum uncertainty ($\mathrm{RD} = 350$) distort the rating network:
- A novice who will settle at $1200$ appears as an even $53\%$ match against a $1521$ veteran.
- When the veteran wins, minimal rating is awarded ($\mathrm{RD}=350$ dampening). When the veteran loses, standard Glicko penalizes them severely as if they lost an even coin-flip.
- This creates the 50% underconfidence droop and tail overconfidence.

#### Dual-Criterion Recalibration Rules
To resolve this without discarding historical matches, GlickoD* operates a two-pass architecture:
- **Criterion 1 (Standard Active Threshold)**: When a player reaches 15 career games, their emergent rating $R_{15}$ is discovered in Pass 1. In Pass 2, matches 1..15 are calculated with the player anchored at $R_{15}$, giving opponents fair, non-cyclical updates.
- **Criterion 2 (Inactive Accounts at $K$ Games)**: Exactly 778 historical players completed between 1 and 14 matches before permanently retiring. Under Criterion 2, any player with $K < 15$ games who is inactive for $> 1$ year (365 days) is recalibrated at their individual career maximum $K \in [1, 14]$.

#### Transition Month Splitting
When a player reaches their threshold ($K$ games) mid-month:
- Matches $1 \dots K$ are processed to establish the prior.
- Matches $K+1 \dots$ in that same month update dynamically from $R_K$, preventing double-counting.

### 5.4 The Empirical Investigation & Retirement of Temperature Scaling

#### The Initial Hypothesis
Standard Glicko exhibited consistent overconfidence in high probability bins: games predicted at $\ge 90\%$ were won in only $\approx 89\%$ of cases. We initially hypothesized an entropic ceiling on skill expression in *Through the Ages* and formulated Adaptive Temperature Scaling $T(P, N) > 1.0$ to compress probabilities toward $50\%$.

#### Diagnostic Ablation on Elite Players (Top 3%)
A targeted audit of games played by top-3% elite competitors ($\ge 1850$ rating) disproved the entropy hypothesis:
1. **Skill Expression Is Profound**: In matches between established elite players and lower-tier opponents, top players genuinely win $\ge 95\%$ and up to $98\%$ of games. The 99% certainty does exist when rating disparity is authentic.
2. **Root Cause Identified**: The apparent overconfidence was caused by uncalibrated newcomers (future masters playing their first 5 games) competing against veterans under uninformative 1500 priors.
3. **Retirement of Temperature Scaling**: Once the 15-Game Recalibration Breakthrough resolved newcomer noise at the root, overconfidence vanished entirely. Adding temperature scaling on top of calibrated priors caused artificial underconfidence (+2% to +3% error). Consequently, **temperature scaling was retired from GlickoD*** ($T \equiv 1.0$).
